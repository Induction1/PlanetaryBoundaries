# Enhanced Planetary Boundaries

This research project is about creating an enhanced Planetary Boundaries with detailed information of nonrenewable energy stocks and critical metal consumptions.

The main doc link for research collaboration is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BQxb_64Y3AaJucbi4gKFQSzHyF9mcKbcQFAaD9j6oKM/edit?usp=sharing) which was used to collect for discussion with 


## Graph Generation
The below graph was created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). 

Particularly, the radial graph of the "Enhanced Planetary Boundaries with Critical Metal and Energy Stocks" graph was first generated as a prototype with a JavaScript program using the d3 library in order to create the exact radius of each segament. Then the prototype was enhanced using Inkscape to add the double-arraws and other features.
